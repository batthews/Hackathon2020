### Retrieve Kenpom Ratings from kenpom.com
#   Kenpom ratings are a pythangorean transformation of tempo free NCAABB stats 
#   that have been compiled by Ken Pomeroy since 2002 
### Adapted from: https://github.com/lbenz730/NCAA_Hoops_Play_By_Play/blob/master/kenpom_scraper.R

### Again Adapted now from https://www.kaggle.com/paulorzp/kenpom-scraper-2020
### I will attempt to make this able to scrap from the past before
#   tournament games are actually played, allowing us to use
### the data for predicting past tournaments and testing our models

library(XML)
library(RCurl)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

### Pull Data
### updated to pull from web archive, hoping elements remain the same!
### Have to update, gonna remove the  year functionality, so we will deal with one year at a time, manually changed
### Have to manually change the url and years
url <- paste0("https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185354/http://kenpom.com/")
x <- as.data.frame(readHTMLTable(getURL(url))[[1]])

### Clean Data
names(x) <- c("rank", "team", "conference", "record", "adj_em", "adj_o", 
              "adj_o_rank", "adj_d", "adj_d_rank", "adj_tempo", "adj_tempo_rank", 
              "luck", "luck_rank", "sos_adj_em", "sos_adj_em_rank", "sos_adj_o",
              "sos_adj_o_rank","sos_adj_d", "sos_adj_d_rank", "nc_sos_adj_em", 
              "nc_sos_adj_em_rank")
x <- filter(x, !team %in% c("", "Team"))
for(i in 5:ncol(x)) {
  x[,i] <- as.numeric(as.character(x[,i]))
}
x <- mutate(x, 
            "ncaa_seed" = sapply(team, function(arg) { as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9]", "", arg)) }),
            "team" = sapply(team, function(arg) { gsub("\\s[0-9]+", "", arg) }),
            "year" = 2015)

### Store Data
